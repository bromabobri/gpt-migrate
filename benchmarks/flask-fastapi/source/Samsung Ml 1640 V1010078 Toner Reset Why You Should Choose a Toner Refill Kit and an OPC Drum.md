If you have a Samsung ML-1640 laser printer, you may have encountered the problem of the toner cartridge reaching its maximum page count and refusing to print any more pages. This is because the toner cartridge has a chip that limits its usage to a certain number of pages, regardless of how much toner is left in it. This is a way for Samsung to make you buy new toner cartridges more often, even if you can refill them with toner refill kits.

Fortunately, there is a way to reset the chip and make your printer use the toner cartridge again. This can save you money and reduce waste. In this article, we will show you how to reset the Samsung ML-1640 toner cartridge using two methods: manually and with a software tool.
 
## Method 1: Reset the Chip Manually
 
This method involves opening the printer and shorting two pins on the chip while turning it on. This will reset the chip and clear the page count. You will need a screwdriver, a pair of tweezers, and some electrical tape for this method. Follow these steps:
 
1. Turn off the printer and unplug it from the power source.
2. Open the front cover and remove the toner cartridge.
3. Locate the chip on the side of the toner cartridge. It is a small black square with four metal pins on it.
4. Cover two opposite pins on the chip with electrical tape. These are pins 1 and 4, as shown in the picture below.

6. Put the toner cartridge back into the printer and close the front cover.
7. Plug in the printer and turn it on while holding down the power button for about 10 seconds.
8. Release the power button and wait for the printer to initialize.
9. Open the front cover and remove the toner cartridge again.
10. Remove the electrical tape from the chip pins and put it back into the printer.
11. Close the front cover and print a test page.

If this method works, you should see a green LED on your printer indicating that it is ready to print. If not, try repeating the steps or use method 2 instead.
 
## Method 2: Reset the Chip with a Software Tool
 
This method involves using a software tool that can reset the chip via USB connection. You will need a computer, a USB cable, and a software tool called Samsung ML-1640 Reset[^1^]. Follow these steps:
