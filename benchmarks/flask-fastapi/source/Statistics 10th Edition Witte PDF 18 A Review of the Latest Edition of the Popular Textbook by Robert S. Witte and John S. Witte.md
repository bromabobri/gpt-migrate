The book is organized into 21 chapters that cover the main topics and techniques in statistics. The first chapter introduces the basic concepts and terminology of statistics, such as variables, scales of measurement, and descriptive and inferential statistics. The next four chapters focus on describing data with tables, graphs, averages, and variability measures. The sixth and seventh chapters explain how to measure and predict relationships between variables using correlation and regression. The eighth and ninth chapters introduce the concepts of populations, samples, probability, and sampling distributions. The tenth and eleventh chapters present the general logic and steps of hypothesis testing. The twelfth chapter discusses how to estimate population parameters using confidence intervals. The next six chapters cover different types of hypothesis tests for different situations and data types, such as t tests, analysis of variance, chi-square tests, and nonparametric tests. The last chapter provides a summary of the different tests and how to choose the appropriate one for a given research question[^2^].
 
The book also has several features that enhance the learning experience and help students apply statistics to real-world problems. Each chapter begins with a list of learning objectives and ends with a summary of key points, a list of key terms, a set of review questions, and a set of exercises. The exercises include both computational and conceptual problems that require students to use critical thinking and reasoning skills. The book also provides many examples from different fields and disciplines to illustrate how statistics are used in practice. The examples are followed by step-by-step explanations of how to perform the statistical procedures using a calculator or a computer software program[^2^].
