Gaussian 09 is a popular software package for computational chemistry that can perform a variety of calculations on molecules and reactions. Gaussian 09 Rev D 01 Em64t Torre is a specific version of Gaussian 09 that runs on EM64T (Extended Memory 64 Technology) systems, which are Intel-based processors that support 64-bit computing. EM64T systems include Nehalem and later architectures[^2^].
  
In this article, we will explain what Gaussian 09 Rev D 01 Em64t Torre can do, how to install it, and how to run some basic calculations with it.
