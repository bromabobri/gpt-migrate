## Step 1: Launch Cheat Engine and Scavenger SV-4
 
First, launch Cheat Engine and click on the computer icon on the top left corner. A window will pop up with a list of processes. Find Scavenger SV-4.exe and select it. Click on Open to attach Cheat Engine to the game process.
 
Next, launch Scavenger SV-4 and start a new game or load an existing save. Once you are in the game, pause it and switch back to Cheat Engine.
 
## Step 2: Scan for Values
 
Now, you need to scan for the values that you want to change in the game. For example, if you want to change your gas reserve, you need to find the address that stores the gas reserve value in the memory. To do that, follow these steps:
 
- In Cheat Engine, enter the current value of your gas reserve in the Value box. For example, if you have 100 gas reserve, enter 100.
- Select Exact Value as Scan Type and 4 Bytes as Value Type.
- Click on First Scan and wait for the scan to finish.
- A list of addresses will appear on the left panel. These are the possible addresses that store the gas reserve value.
- Switch back to Scavenger SV-4 and use some gas by driving around or using modules.
- Pause the game and note down your new gas reserve value.
- Switch back to Cheat Engine and enter the new value in the Value box.
- Click on Next Scan and wait for the scan to finish.
- The list of addresses will be narrowed down. Repeat steps 5 to 8 until you have only one address left in the list.
- Congratulations! You have found the address that stores the gas reserve value.

You can use the same method to find other values in the game, such as EVA suit air, rover base power production, modules damage, modules research progress, etc. Just make sure you select the correct Value Type for each value. For example, rover base power production is a Float value type.
 
## Step 3: Change Values
 
Once you have found the addresses that store the values that you want to change, you can modify them as you wish. To do that, follow these steps:

- In Cheat Engine, right-click on the address that you want to change and select Add Address To The List.
- A new entry will appear on the bottom panel with the address, value, description, and other options.
- You can double-click on the Value field and enter a new value that you want. For example, if you want to have infinite gas reserve, enter 9999.
- You can also double-click on the Description field and give a name to the address for easy identification. For example, Gas Reserve.
- If you want to freeze the value so that it doesn't change in the game, check the box under Active.
- Switch back to Scavenger SV-4 and resume the game. You will see that your gas reserve has changed to 9999 and stays that way even if you use gas.

You can change any value that you want using this method. Just be careful not to enter unrealistic values that may cause glitches or crashes in the game. Also,
