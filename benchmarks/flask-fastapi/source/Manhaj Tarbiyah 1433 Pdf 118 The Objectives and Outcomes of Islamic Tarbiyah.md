Manhaj Tarbiyah is a term that refers to the Islamic methodology of education and upbringing. It is derived from the Arabic word *tarbiyah*, which means nurturing, cultivating, or training. Manhaj Tarbiyah is based on the Quran and the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), and it aims to develop the Muslim personality in all aspects: spiritual, intellectual, moral, social, and physical.
 
Manhaj Tarbiyah is important because it helps Muslims to fulfill their purpose of life, which is to worship Allah (the Creator) and to be His vicegerents on earth. It also helps Muslims to face the challenges and opportunities of the modern world, while preserving their identity and values. Manhaj Tarbiyah enables Muslims to be productive, responsible, and beneficial members of society, who contribute to the common good and promote peace and justice.
