If you are a metal guitarist who wants to achieve the tones of some of the most iconic and influential players in the genre, you might be interested in the Metal Guitar Gods EZmix Pack by Toontrack. This is an expansion pack for EZmix 2, a plugin that simplifies the mixing process by providing you with ready-made presets for various instruments and effects. The Metal Guitar Gods EZmix Pack focuses solely on amp and cab simulation presets for guitar and bass, and it comes with 50 custom settings designed by four of the metal guitar gods themselves: Fredrik Thordendal (Meshuggah), Mattias IA Eklundh (Freak Kitchen), Misha âBulbâ Mansoor (Periphery) and Devin Townsend (ex-Strapping Young Lad, The Devin Townsend Project) [^1^].

In this article, we will take a closer look at what this pack has to offer, how it sounds, and whether it is worth your money.
 
## What's in the pack?
 
The Metal Guitar Gods EZmix Pack contains 50 presets for guitar and bass, covering a wide range of tones from rhythm, lead and clean sounds to settings for acoustic guitar and bass. Each preset is modeled after the personal tones of one of the four guitarists, and they are labeled accordingly. For example, you can find presets such as âFredrik - Koloss Rhythm LR1â, âIA - Lead 1â, âMisha - Clean 1â and âDevin - Epic Leadâ. You can also see which amp and cab models were used for each preset, as well as any additional effects such as EQ, compression, delay, reverb, chorus, etc.
 
The presets are designed to work well with any guitar or bass input, but you can also tweak them to your liking using the EZmix 2 interface. You can adjust the gain, volume, pan and tone controls, as well as switch between different amp and cab models or effects if you want to experiment with different combinations. You can also save your own custom presets and recall them later.
 
## How does it sound?
 
The Metal Guitar Gods EZmix Pack sounds amazing. The presets are very realistic and authentic, capturing the essence and character of each guitaristâs style and sound. Whether you want to play heavy riffs with Fredrikâs crushing tone, shred solos with IAâs expressive touch, create ambient textures with Mishaâs clean settings or rock out with Devinâs epic leads, you will find something that suits your needs in this pack. The presets are also very versatile and dynamic, responding well to your playing technique and expression. You can go from clean to distorted with just your pick attack, or use your volume knob to control the amount of gain and saturation.
 
The pack also covers a lot of ground in terms of genres and styles. You can play anything from progressive metal to djent to rock to fusion with these presets, and they will always sound great. The pack also includes some acoustic guitar and bass settings that are very useful for adding some contrast and variety to your tracks. The acoustic guitar presets sound very natural and organic, while the bass presets are punchy and tight.
