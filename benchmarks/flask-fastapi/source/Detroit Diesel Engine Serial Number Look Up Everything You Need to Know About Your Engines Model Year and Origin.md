## Locating the Engine Data Plate or Tag
 
The easiest way to find your Detroit Diesel engine serial number and model is to look at the engine data plate or tag. This is a metal plate that is attached to the engine bell cover, which is located at the top of the engine. The bell cover is a round metal cover that protects the flywheel housing and the clutch assembly.
 
The engine data plate or tag contains various information about your engine, such as its model number, serial number, horsepower rating, date of manufacture, and service information. The serial number is usually stamped into the block beneath the data plate or tag.
 
To locate the engine data plate or tag, you need to open the hood of your vehicle and look for the bell cover at the top of the engine. You may need to remove some components or wires to access it. The data plate or tag should be in the middle of the bell cover, but it may vary depending on the configuration of your engine. You can use a flashlight or a mirror to read the information on the data plate or tag.
  
## Locating the Serial Number on the Engine Block
 
If you cannot find or access the engine data plate or tag, you can also look for the serial number on the engine block itself. The serial number is a series of numbers and letters that identifies your specific engine. It usually starts with the number of cylinders followed by a letter that indicates the series. For example, a 4-53 engine has four cylinders and belongs to the 53 series.
 
The location of the serial number on the engine block depends on the type and model of your engine. Here are some common locations for different Detroit Diesel engines:
 
- Inline 53 series engines (253, 353, 453): The serial number can be found on any one of the flat surfaces on the corners of the airbox, very close to the deck. The airbox is a rectangular metal box that covers the intake ports of the cylinders. The deck is the flat surface where the cylinder head bolts onto.
- V53 series engines (6V53, 8V53): The serial number can be found on the front right bank deck of the engine, in front of the right bank cylinder head. The cylinder head is a metal component that covers the top of the cylinders and contains valves and spark plugs.
- Inline 71 series engines (271, 371, 471, 671): The serial number can be found on a small flat section towards the front right of the cylinder block. The cylinder block is a large metal component that houses the cylinders and pistons.
- V71 series engines (6V71, 8V71, 12V71, 16V71): The serial number can be found on the right rear of the engine, close to or underneath
the air box drain tube. The air box drain tube is a small hose that drains excess oil from
the air box.
- 92 series engines (6V92, 8V92): The serial number can be found on
the left side of
the cylinder block,
near
the oil cooler.
The oil cooler is
a device that cools
the oil
circulating in
the engine.
- Series 50 and 60 engines: The serial number can be found on
the left side of
the cylinder block,
near
the rear end.
The rear end is
the opposite side
of
the flywheel housing.
- 149 series engines (8V149, 8cf37b1e13
