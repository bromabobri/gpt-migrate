But how can you download and install this free DLC for your game? Here are the steps you need to follow:
 
1. First, you need to have Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire installed on your PC. If you don't have it yet, you can buy it from Steam[^2^] or other online platforms. Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire is a sequel to the multi-award-winning RPG Pillars of Eternity, where you pursue a rogue god over land and sea in a vast unexplored archipelago region. You can captain your ship on a dangerous voyage of discovery, build your own party of companions, and explore a rich world full of mystery and adventure.
2. Second, you need to download the crack file for Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire - Beard and Hair Pack from a reliable source. A crack file is a modified version of the game that bypasses the DRM (digital rights management) protection and allows you to play the game without paying for it. However, downloading crack files is illegal and risky, as they may contain viruses, malware, or spyware that can harm your PC or steal your personal information. Therefore, we do not recommend or endorse downloading crack files for any game.
3. Third, you need to extract the crack file using a software like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You will get a folder with the name of the DLC and some files inside it. You need to copy these files and paste them into the game directory where Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire is installed. Usually, the game directory is located at C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Pillars of Eternity II. You may need to overwrite some existing files when you paste the crack files.
4. Fourth, you need to launch the game and enjoy the new features of Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire - Beard and Hair Pack. You can access the new customization options from the character creation screen or from any barber shop in the game world. You can also change your personality setting from the character sheet menu. Have fun with your new look!
