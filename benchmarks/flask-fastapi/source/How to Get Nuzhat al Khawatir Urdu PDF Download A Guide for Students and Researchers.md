- Abdullah bin Alawi Al-Haddad: He was a famous Sufi saint and scholar of Yemen who visited India in the 10th century. He met many Indian scholars and saints and wrote a book called Al-Sirat Al-Mustaqim (The Straight Path) which is a guide for spiritual seekers.

## The Sultanate Period
 
This period marks the establishment of Muslim dynasties and kingdoms in various parts of India from the 12th to the 16th century.

Some of the notable figures of this period are:
