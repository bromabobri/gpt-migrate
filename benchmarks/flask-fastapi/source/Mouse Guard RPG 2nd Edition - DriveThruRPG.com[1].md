- **Character creation:** You can create your own mouse character by choosing their name, fur color, home town, rank, cloak color, skills, traits, beliefs, goals, and instincts. You can also choose a special ability from one of the six mouse natures: bold, cunning, generous, independent, loyal, or skeptical.
- **Patrols and missions:** You can form a patrol with other players and take on missions assigned by the Mouse Guard leader. Missions can involve exploring new territories, delivering messages, escorting travelers, fighting predators, resolving conflicts, and more. You can also create your own missions using the guidelines in the book.

You can also engage in conflicts with other characters or creatures using a simple system of actions and cards. Conflicts can be physical, mental, social, or environmental.
- **Seasons and conditions:** The game is divided into four seasons: spring, summer, fall, and winter. Each season has its own challenges and opportunities for the mice.

> "Mouse Guard is a tabletop RPG that captures the spirit and charm of the comics. It is easy to learn and play, and it offers a lot of opportunities for adventure and storytelling. If you love mice, fantasy, and role-playing, you should definitely give it a try."[^1^]

> "This pdf is of excellent quality! Although it does lack bookmarks - the page numbers are correct (a rarity among pdf copies) and there is a table of contents on page 3. I bought this book despite the multiple warnings I saw around the internet and in this comment section. I do own the physical copy, the digital version is just for easier access. I have to say, I don't know if the publisher has updated the downloadable or if the negative comments are overstating the issues, but I find this digital version of Mouse Guard 2e to be very well-done. The images do have some slight artifacting, but they are still very legible. The images and overall quality of the book is excellent! Nearly as good as the original book!"[^2^]

> "This game has a great concept, based on a comic book named Mouse Guard. The mice are the sentient beings, but they are also the smallest. So you're role playing season to season and how the mice interact with their natural habitat, including the food they eat and the predators they encounter."[^3^]
