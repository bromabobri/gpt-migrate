## Create a Simple C# Project that Uses EAGetMail
 
To demonstrate how to use EAGetMail POP3 IMAP4 Component 7.5.0.3 in C#, we will create a simple console application that can send and receive emails.
 
Open Visual Studio and create a new C# console project. Name it "EAGetMailDemo" and click OK.
 
In the Solution Explorer, right-click on the References node and select Add Reference. In the Browse tab, navigate to the folder where you installed EAGetMail and select the file "EAGetMail45.dll". Click OK to add the reference to your project.
 
In the Program.cs file, add the following using statements at the top:
  ```csharp using System; using System.IO; using System.Net.Mail; using EAGetMail; ```  
These statements will allow us to use the classes and methods from EAGetMail and other .NET namespaces.
  
## Configure the Email Settings for POP3 or IMAP4
 
To send and receive emails with EAGetMail, we need to configure the email settings for our email account. We can use either POP3 or IMAP4 protocol depending on our preference and server support.
 
In this example, we will use Gmail as our email provider and IMAP4 as our protocol. You can use any other email provider and protocol as long as you know the correct server address, port number, user name, password, and SSL/TLS settings.
 
To configure the email settings for IMAP4, we need to create an instance of the MailServer class and set its properties accordingly:
  ```csharp // Create a mail server object MailServer oServer = new MailServer(     "imap.gmail.com", // Server address     "your_email@gmail.com", // User name     "your_password", // Password     ServerProtocol.Imap4 // Protocol );  // Enable SSL/TLS connection oServer.SSLConnection = true;  // Set server port oServer.Port = 993; ```  
If you want to use POP3 instead of IMAP4, you need to change the protocol parameter to ServerProtocol.Pop3 and the port number to 995.
